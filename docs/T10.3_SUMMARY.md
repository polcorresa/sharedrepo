# T10.3 Summary: Tree View Realtime Updates

## Overview
Implemented real-time updates for the file tree using WebSockets.

## Components

### 1. Hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useTree.ts`)
- **WebSocket Connection**:
  - Connects to `/ws/repo/:slug/tree` on mount.
  - Listens for `TreeEvent` messages.
- **Reconciliation**:
  - On receiving an event, calls `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['repo', slug, 'tree'])`.
  - This triggers a refetch of the tree, ensuring the UI is in sync with the server.
  - This strategy is robust and avoids complex client-side state management for v1.

## Verification
- `pnpm --filter @sharedrepo/web typecheck` passed.
- WebSocket connection logic added.
